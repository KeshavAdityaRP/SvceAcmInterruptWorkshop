					<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
					<p class="paragraphs">I am Jon Snow, born Aegon Targaryen, the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, the late Prince of Dragonstone. From infancy, I was presented as the illegitimate son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, and raised by Eddard alongside his lawful children at Winterfell but my true parentage was kept secret from everyone, including myself. In order to escape my bastard status, I joined the Night's Watch and was eventually chosen as Lord Commander. </p>

					<p class="paragraphs">However, I was murdered in a mutiny and eventually resurrected by the Red Priestess Melisandre. Freed from my Night's Watch vows, I joined my cousin, Sansa Stark, in building an army and together we retook Winterfell from House Bolton, restoring House Stark's dominion over the North and I was declared the new King in the North. However, after successfully capturing a wight and presenting it to the Lannisters as proof that the Army of the Dead are real, I pledged myself and my army to Daenerys Targaryen, Rhaegar's sister, and stepped down as King of the North</p>

					<h3>My Favorite Weapon</h3>
					<p class="paragraphs">Longclaw is a Valyrian steel sword that was the ancestral weapon of House Mormont for five centuries. When Lord Jeor Mormont retired from his lordship to take the black and command the Night's Watch, he passed it to his son and heir, Ser Jorah Mormont. When Jorah went into exile after trying to sell some poachers into slavery, he left the sword and Ser Jeor Mormont's sister returned it to him on the Wall.
					Years later, Jeor gave Longclaw to me as a reward for saving his life from a wight. Before giving it to me, he had the pommel remade, replacing the bear with a direwolf, the sigil of House Stark.

					Longclaw is my favorite weapon because it is a bastard sword or hand and a half sword, which means it is a good half a foot longer than a standard long sword, tapered to thrust as well as slash with three fullers incised into the blade to reduce weight. There are ripples in the dark steel indicating it is of Valyrian steel.

					I was instrumental in dealing with a wight that crossed over the wall, and was rewarded with Longclaw, the mighty Valyrian Steel sword for my efforts. 
					Following this, I led an expedition along with the Lord Commander beyond the wall, and joined slaid Qhorin Halfhand as part of my covert operation into the Wildling camp. I successfully posed as a deserter of the Night's Watch and learned the tactics of the Wildlings. Later, I rejoined the Night's watch and with the help of Stannis Baratheon, I successfully captured and slayed the King Beyond the Wall - Mance Rayder. After my resurrection, I took over Winterfell from the traitor Bolton and was crowned King in the North.</p>
